            <h5> 
                The mean for the 2022 Monthly Global GDP Growth Rate is 0.35, and the mode is 0.2. Based on the Box and Whisker Plot, the 1st Quartile is 0.2, the median 0.35, and the 3rd Quartile is 0.5. The histogram has no skewness, but rather, it has a dip because there hasn’t been an instance in this year when the Monthly GDP Growth Rate went anywhere between 0.3-0.4. The standard deviation is 0.15666989, and there are no outliers.
                We can infer that the average GDP Growth Rate in 2022 is 0.35. This is because the mean is the best to consider as the average since there are no outliers. This year’s standard deviation being lower than the previous tells us that there’s been less changes in the GDP Growth Rate throughout 2022 compared to 2021.

                The mean for the 2022 Monthly Global Unemployment Rate is 5, and the mode is 4.9. Based on the Box and Whisker Plot, the 1st Quartile is 4.9, the median is 4.95, and the 3rd Quartile is 5.075. It is positively skewed or skewed to the right. The standard deviation is 0.134839972, and there are no outliers.
                
                We can infer that the average Unemployment Rate in 2021 is 5.0. This is because the mean is the best to consider as the average since there are no outliers. This year’s standard deviation being lower than the previous tells us that there’s been less changes in the Unemployment Rate throughout 2022 compared to 2021.
