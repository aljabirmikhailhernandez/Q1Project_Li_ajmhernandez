                The mean for the 2020 Monthly Global GDP Growth Rate is -0.375, and the mode is -1.7. Based on the Box and Whisker Plot, the 1st Quartile is -8.225, the median is -0.3, and the 3rd Quartile is 7.4. It is positively skewed or skewed to the right. The standard deviation is 7.421360449, and there are no outliers.

We can infer that the average GDP Growth Rate in 2019 is -0.375. This is because the mean is the best to consider as the average since there are no outliers. This year’s standard deviation being way higher than the previous tells us that there’s been much more changes in the GDP Growth Rate throughout 2020 compared to 2019.

The mean for the 2020 Monthly Global Unemployment Rate is 7.175, and the mode is 5.3. Based on the Box and Whisker Plot, the 1st Quartile is 5.925, the median is 7.25, and the 3rd Quartile is 8.275. It has a uniform distribution in its histogram, having an equal spread. The standard deviation is 1.249818169, and there are no outliers.

We can infer that the average Unemployment Rate in 2019 is 7.175. This is because the mean is the best to consider as the average since there are no outliers. This year’s standard deviation being higher than the previous tells us that there’s been more changes in the Unemployment Rate throughout 2020 compared to 2019.
