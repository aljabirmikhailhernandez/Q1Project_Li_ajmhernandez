            <h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
            <h2>Discussing the Quantitative Variables as Affected by the Pandemic</h2>
            <p>The seismic effects of the pandemic were visible in the GDP Growth Rate, a crucial quantitative indicator of economic health. With an average rate of 0.4 in 2019, the economy seemed to be fairly stable. But the world experienced an unprecedented crisis in 2020, and the GDP growth rate fell to -0.375. The fact that entire industries collapsed and economic uncertainty encompassed whole countries served as a sobering reminder of the pandemic's devastating effects.However, as 2021 drew, a ray of hope appeared. The GDP Growth Rate significantly increased and eventually averaged 1.325, indicating that the initial shock to the economies had begun to subside. By 2022, although not fully restored to pre-pandemic levels, the average rate had climbed to 0.35, suggesting that progress was being made, and a degree of economic normality was being achieved. <br><br> The Unemployment Rate increased to 7.175 in 2020, reflecting the depressing wave of job losses and financial hardship brought on by the pandemic, from an average of 5.425 in 2019. It's evident that a great number of people suffered, and the job market encountered previously unseen difficulties. The data do have a positive side, though. Even with the persistent economic difficulties, the unemployment rate decreased in 2021, falling to 6.133. The rate continued to decline over time, reaching 5.0 by 2022, suggesting a gradual decline in unemployment. This pattern implies that recovery efforts were having an effect and that the economy was steadily stabilizing.<br><br></p>
            <h2>Discussing the Qualitative Variables as Affected by the Pandemic</h2>
            <p>The GDP Growth Rate Change remained mostly stable in 2019, indicating a sense of stability in the economy. But this stability was upset in 2020 when the pandemic struck. The unpredictable nature of the economic environment is demonstrated by the GDP Growth Rate Change, which fell three times and increased just once. This volatility continued in 2021, as declines in the GDP Growth Rate Change highlighted the pandemic's extensive effects. The difficulties would not be entirely overcome by 2022. There were still ups and downs as well as stable intervals in the GDP Growth Rate Change. It is evident that the economic effects of the pandemic were not easily overcome, and uncertainties lingered.<br><br>In 2019, the unemployment rate decreased more than it increased, suggesting a generally stable labor market. However, a striking change emerged in 2020. The staggering efforts to minimize job losses and the group's determination to address the employment crisis were highlighted by the unemployment rate change, which decreased seven times, compared to the two instances of increase. The downward trend in the unemployment rate change persisted into 2021, reflecting the ongoing improvement in the employment landscape. Although nothing had changed significantly by 2022, there was no longer a crisis. It was an indication of comparatively higher employment rates, showing how resilient the labor market is in the face of hardship.
